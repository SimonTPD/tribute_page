            <h1>Welcome to the Queen tribute page!</h1>

            <p>This page will briefly talk about the band that hold the dearest and most special spot in my heart: Queen. They're the first rock band that I ever remember listening to, and they kickstarted my love for music and rock n' roll. Specifically, my parents lent me the <i>Greatest Hits 1</i> CD, which starts with <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i> and ends with <i>We Are the Champions</i>. A great introduction to rock n' roll to say the least. Lastly, John Deacon, the bass player, is probably the guy that played the biggest role in me picking up the bass in my late teenager years.</p>

            <p id="beforeList">Why I like them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>My parents were big fans, and listening to them that early on is obviously a nostalgic and significant aspect.</li>
                <li>All band members were talented in their own respective ways, which, when brought together with their incredible alchemy, created various and amazing tunes.</li>
                <li>Many of their songs have the power to make me feel certain ways, and also make me reminiscent of different periods of my life.</li>
            </ul>
